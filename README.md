# cpluck
Plucked cello samples by [Trevor Exter](https://trevorexter.bandcamp.com/) - tuned to C with various attacks, styles, releases and octaves, also including some percussive body hits, and riffs

These were developed with the intent to use in tidalcycles, I strongly recommend checking out to an existing samples folder sourced by supercollider as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/cleary/samples-cello-plucked.git /path/to/samples-folder/cpluck
```

then restart supercollider/load the new samples

## extra info

- Cello: "Grandpa" by Karl Laudermann, mfr Berlin 1906
- Pickup: Piezo by Eric Aceto
- Mic: Matched pair Neumann K184 
- Normalised to -1.0db (mostly)
